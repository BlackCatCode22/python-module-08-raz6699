# ChatBotApp.py
# Starter code for Python Chat Bot Program
# CIT-95 (Mohle) Spring 2024
# last updated: 4/24/24 by dH
# Suggested things to do:
#   Add chat memory
#   Use a local server like streamlit
#   Modify streamlit with HTML to make a nice looking chat bot
#   Use langchain framework to read .pdf files
#   Use an open source LLM that doesn't cost tokens

# pip install this dependency if you don't have this already
# pip install python-dotenv openai
# pip install --upgrade openai
# pip install --upgrade python-dotenv
